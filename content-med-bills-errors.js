  faq: [
    ["How common are billing errors in medical debts that end up in lawsuits?", "Very common. When debts are sold between collectors, documentation frequently gets lost or distorted. Upcoded charges, phantom procedures, and duplicate bills are all routine."],
    ["What does “challenge the validity” of a medical debt in court mean?", "It means formally requiring the collector to prove the debt is accurate, that they legally own it, and that they have the right to collect it. Many collectors cannot."],
    ["If the debt is challenged successfully, does it come off my credit report?", "Yes. If a debt is dismissed or settled on favorable terms, you can request its removal from your credit report under the FCRA."],
    ["Do I still need to respond to the lawsuit even if I think the bill is wrong?", "Yes, and urgently. Failing to respond results in a default judgment regardless of whether the bill is right."],
    ["How much does this cost?", "Your consultation is free. We offer flexible payment plans and will walk you through every option before committing."],
