/* Credo Legal — Garnishment / Post-Judgment — "Exemptions" angle.
   Source: live capture LP_PostJudgment-Garn_VarB_Exemptions.md (2026-06-01).

   Sibling of /wage-garnishment-attorney (URL #13, Var A Fight Active)
   in the Post-Judgment Garn ad group: same phone (720) 414-1751,
   different framing. This LP narrows specifically to exemptions
   (head of household, federal benefits, low income); the sibling is
   general "fight the garnishment".

   Per-LP deviations resolved (heaviest synthesis of any LP so far):
   - Why Choose label-only bullets on live → expanded to label+body
     matching cluster template.
   - Common Problems label-only bullets on live → expanded to
     label+body + citations. Count 5→6 (added 'Improperly calculated
     disposable income' 15 U.S.C. § 1672(b)).
   - HIW step 4 concatenated on live ('Work Towards Debt Resolution.
     Reduce the amount being taken, or stop it entirely') → split
     into label + body.
   - Your Rights 5 → 6 (added 'Retroactive exemption filing' as 6th
     matching the angle).
   - FAQ 4 → 5 (added 'Are exemptions automatic?' matching cluster
     pattern about retroactivity).
   - Bottom CTA was heading-only on live → added body matching the
     angle's 'you may not know you qualify' framing.

   Universal voice fixes (3 instances on this LP):
   - Hero subhead: 'Real Attorneys Can Help' → 'Our Attorneys Can Help'
   - Why Choose b4 label: 'Real Attorneys Review Your Full Case' →
     'Our Attorneys Review Your Full Case'
   - FAQ last item body: 'real attorney help is affordable' → 'attorney
     help is affordable'
   - State exclusion list includes NC. */
