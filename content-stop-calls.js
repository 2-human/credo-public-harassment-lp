/* Credo Legal — Harassment / Stop Calls (emotional relief angle) content model.
   Source: live re-fetch of https://start.credolegal.com/debt-harassment-stop-calls
   (2026-06-23), supersedes the 2026-06-01 capture which had placeholders.

   Per-LP deviation handled per 2026-06-23 socratic decision:
   - Live page renders What We Do as a single paragraph with no bullets
     (deviation from the standard 14-block "intro + 4 bullets" pattern).
     Fix: keep the live intro, then distill 4 bullets from the action
     sentences in the paragraph. Faithful to the live copy.

   Universal fixes applied:
   - "We're real lawyers" (Why Choose bullet 1) → "Our attorneys are real lawyers"
   - "Real Attorneys Can Make Them Stop." (live subhead) → "Our Attorneys Can Make Them Stop."
   - State exclusion list includes NC (Action 1)

   Design enhancements applied per 2026-06-23 decisions:
   - Common Problems gains FDCPA § citations per bullet
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items (cite + label +
     body + violation/right/remedy example)
   - Trust strip = prototype's compliance-safe credentials. */
