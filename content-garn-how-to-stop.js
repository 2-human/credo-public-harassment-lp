/* Credo Legal — Garnishment — "How to stop a garnishment" (NEW, search-term gap).
   Proposed 2026-09-30 from the search-term review (now in the Marketing Hub, Ads › New pages).
   Intent: the "how to stop (a) (wage) garnishment" query family, the account's
   highest-volume garnishment searches (17–27% CTR). Live traffic lands on
   /wage-garnishment-prevention (61% of the ad group's impressions), which is
   written for someone NOT yet garnished; "stop" usually means it has started.
   This page answers both stages: the H1 mirrors the query, the form's
   situation options start with the stage, and every section splits
   "already started" from "not started yet".
   Not live: proposed slug /how-to-stop-wage-garnishment. Phone = the
   Garnishment pages' number. Draft copy for attorney review. */

    ["How quickly can a garnishment be stopped?", "It depends on the remedy and the court. Exemption claims usually have a hearing within weeks. We file as soon as we have your notice and pay details, because deadlines can be short."],
    ["How much of my paycheck can be taken?", "Federal law limits most consumer-debt garnishments to 25% of disposable earnings, and less if you earn close to the minimum wage. Several states set lower limits."],
    ["What if I never knew I was sued?", "That happens often. If you were not properly served, we can ask the court to set aside the default judgment, which also undoes the garnishment built on it."],
    ["How much does this cost?", "Your first case evaluation is free. Ongoing representation is a flat monthly fee, with payment plans that fit what is left of your paycheck."],
