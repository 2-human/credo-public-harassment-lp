    ["Can a payday loan be challenged if I actually borrowed the money?", "Yes, in many cases. The original loan amount may be legally disputed if the lender was unlicensed, if the rate was above the state cap, or if disclosures were inadequate."],
    ["What if I borrowed from an online lender I found through an ad?", "Online payday lenders are required to be licensed in the state where the borrower lives. Many are not. Lack of licensing where you live can void the loan."],
