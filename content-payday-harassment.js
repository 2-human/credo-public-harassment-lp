/* Credo Legal — Payday Loan / Harassment — "Stop Calls" angle.
   Source: live capture LP_PaydayLoan-Harassment_VarA_StopCalls - DYN.md
   (2026-06-01). Bracketed placeholders inferred from context.

   FIRST PAYDAY-CLUSTER LP applied to the new design. The Payday cluster
   introduces vertical-specific mechanics not present in other clusters:
   - EFTA / ACH revocation rights (15 U.S.C. § 1693) — payday lenders
     typically debit via ACH; consumers can revoke that authorization
     independent of resolving the underlying debt.
   - Military Lending Act 36% rate cap (10 U.S.C. § 987) — active-duty
     service members protected against predatory rates.
   - State-specific payday loan rules — some states ban payday loans;
     others cap rates; loan validity varies by jurisdiction.

   Sibling of /payday-loan-debt-violations (URL #18, Var B Violations
   Payoff) in the Payday_Brand_Harassment ad group: same phone
   (407) 512-0808, different framing.

   Per-LP deviations resolved:
   - SUBHEAD-ANGLE MISMATCH on live: H1 frames Stop Calls but subhead
     reads 'Make Them Pay' (VarB Violations angle, looks copy-pasted).
     Rewritten here to match VarA Stop Calls framing.
   - Voice fix: hero subhead 'Real Attorneys' → 'Our Attorneys'.
   - Voice fix: Why Choose b1 body 'We're real lawyers' → 'Our
     attorneys are real lawyers'.
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   No structural deviations. Standard 14-block template.
   Common Problems section heading on live reads 'Common Examples Of
   Payday Lender Harassment We May Stop' — angle-specific variation,
   preserved here. */
