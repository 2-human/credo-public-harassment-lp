/* Credo Legal — FDCPA Harassment / Rights Education ("Know Your FDCPA Rights")
   VERBATIM live copy from https://start.credolegal.com/debt-harassment-fdcpa-rights.
   Source: LP_Harassment-FDCPA_VarA_Education.md (captured 2026-06-01).
   Performance: Harassment cluster CHAMPION — 33.5 conv, 7% CTR.

   Differs from the original prototype's content.js, which carries the Action 6
   rewrite ("Make the collection calls stop. Legally."). This file is for the
   verbatim live-copy A/B comparison approved 2026-06-23.

   Universal fixes applied:
   - "Real Attorneys" → "Our Attorneys" voice fix (2 instances in hero;
     none observed in body sections of this LP).
   - State exclusion list includes NC (Action 1).

   Design enhancements applied per 2026-06-23 socratic decisions:
   - Common Problems gains FDCPA § citations per bullet
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items (cite + label +
     body + violation/right/remedy example)
   - Trust strip = prototype's compliance-safe credentials. */
