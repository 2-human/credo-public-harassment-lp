/* Credo Legal — Lawsuit / Defense — "Level the Field" angle.
   Source: live re-fetch of https://start.credolegal.com/debt-lawsuit-attorney
   (2026-06-23), supersedes the 2026-06-01 capture which had placeholders.

   First Lawsuit cluster LP applied to the new design. The Lawsuit cluster
   diverges from Harassment in two ways:
   - Section heading shifts to "Your Rights Under [Federal / Civil] Law" —
     statute citations on Common Problems and Your Rights items are a MIX
     of FDCPA (still applies to collector misconduct in court filings),
     FRCP / FRE (federal civil procedure + evidence), and general
     due-process principles rather than pure FDCPA § 1692 references.
   - Phone routing differs: (347) 523-4568 for Defense, shared between
     Defense_VarA (FightBack) and Defense_VarB (LevelField).

   No per-LP structural deviations. Standard 14-block template.

   Universal fixes:
   - Hero subhead already shows "Our Attorneys" on live (capture flagged
     "Real Attorneys" — fixed upstream).
   - Why Choose bullet 1 body still says "Real lawyers handle your case"
     on live → fixed here ("Our attorneys handle your case").
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Design enhancements applied per 2026-06-23 decisions:
   - Common Problems gains citation tags (FRCP / FRE / FDCPA mix)
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING; lawsuit-defense
     timeline reflects the typical 20–28 day response window)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items
   - Trust strip = prototype's compliance-safe credentials. */
