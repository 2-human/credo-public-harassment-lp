/* Credo Legal — Lawsuit / Collection_Lawsuit — "Proof Challenge" angle.
   Source: live capture LP_Lawsuit-Collection_VarB_ProofChallenge.md
   (2026-06-01, light bracketed completions filled from context).

   Sibling of /debt-lawsuit-respond-on-time (Collection_Lawsuit Var A
   Urgency) — same H1, same phone (212) 561-5902, different framing.
   This LP leans proof-challenge ("demand the records"); the sibling
   leans deadline-urgency ("respond on time").

   No structural deviations from the standard 14-block template.

   Universal fix:
   - Hero subhead: "Real Attorneys" → "Our Attorneys".
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Design enhancements applied:
   - Common Problems gains FRE / FCRA / state-SOL citations
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items
   - Trust strip = Lawsuit-cluster "Court / Defense, not settlement only". */
