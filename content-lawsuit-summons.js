/* Credo Legal — Lawsuit / Served_Papers — "Act Now / Immediate Action" angle.
   Source: live capture LP_Lawsuit-ServedPapers_VarA_ActNow.md (2026-06-01).

   Sibling of /debt-lawsuit-options (URL #9, Served_Papers Var B
   Reassurance) in the Served_Papers ad group: same phone (347) 523-4662,
   different framing + lede + Bottom CTA. This LP is urgent/aggressive
   ("Act Today"); the sibling is calming/explanatory ("One Free
   Conversation").

   Per-LP deviations resolved:
   - Subhead typo on live: "Repond" → "Respond" (May action item).
   - WRONG FAQ #1 content: live page's first FAQ ("What exactly happens
     if I do not respond to the court papers?") has an answer copy-
     pasted from an FDCPA cease-letter LP — wrong context entirely.
     Fixed here with a correct default-judgment answer that matches
     the question.
   - Common Problems 5 → 6: synthesized 6th 'Wage garnishment and
     asset seizure after default' (15 U.S.C. § 1673 + state levy
     rules) — same consequence-chain logic as the URL #11 champion.

   Universal voice fixes (4 instances on this LP):
   - Hero subhead: 'Real Attorneys' → 'Our Attorneys'.
   - WWD bullet 5: 'real attorneys, not salespeople' → 'our attorneys,
     not salespeople'.
   - Why Choose b2 label: 'Real Attorneys' → 'Our Attorneys'.
   - Why Choose b2 body: 'Real legal authority' → 'Real legal
     authority' (kept — 'real' as adjective is fine; only the
     pronoun substitution rule applies).
   - State exclusion list includes NC. */

  faq: [
    ["What exactly happens if I do not respond to the court papers?", "The court enters a default judgment against you automatically, without ever hearing your side. That judgment gives the collector the legal right to garnish your wages, freeze your bank accounts, and place liens on your property. Responding is what preserves your right to be heard."],
    ["How long do I actually have to respond?", "In most states, 20 to 28 days from the date you were served, not the date you opened the papers. The clock starts at service."],
    ["What if my deadline has already passed?", "Depending on the circumstances, a default judgment may still be challengeable. We can review your case and advise on whether there are grounds to reopen it."],
    ["Do I have to appear in court myself?", "In most cases, no. Our attorneys file all required documents and can appear on your behalf."],
    ["What if I think the debt is not mine or the amount is wrong?", "That is exactly what we examine before filing your response. Many collection suits include errors, inflated balances, or invalid claims."],
